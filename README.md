# Connecteam Landing Page

A responsive landing page built with React, designed to closely follow the provided Figma design specifications. The project features a hero section, four content sections, and a footer with an operable form, all while implementing a design faithfully, maintaining high code quality, and demonstrating independence.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Main framework for building the user interface.
- **Vite**: Chosen for its fast development server and optimized build process, significantly improving the development experience.
- **vite-plugin-svgr**: Used to import SVGs as React components, allowing for easier manipulation and styling of icons directly within the JSX.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JSON**: Fetched content and images from .json files to simulate an API.


## Hosting

The landing page is hosted online and accessible at [https://danimatuko-connecteam.netlify.app/].

## Notable Decisions

I chose **Vite** as the development tool due to its fast server start times and hot module replacement, which significantly speeds up the development process. This decision enhances the overall developer experience by allowing for rapid iteration and immediate feedback.

Additionally, I incorporated **vite-plugin-svgr** to enable the importing of SVGs as React components. This approach provides greater flexibility in styling and manipulating SVGs directly within the application, improving maintainability and performance while staying true to the design.

Another interesting decision was to focus on creating smooth transitions between sections to make the page feel more dynamic and engaging while ensuring that the design remains cohesive across all screen sizes.
